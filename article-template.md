# The War of the Roses

The War of the Roses was a series of civil wars fought in England from 1455 to 1487 between the House of Lancaster (represented by a red rose) and the House of York (represented by a white rose). The conflict was primarily driven by political and financial power struggles, and involved several changes of the English monarchy [@bennett_edward_1998].

The wars ended with the victory of the Lancastrian Henry VII, who became the first monarch of the Tudor dynasty. He united the two houses by marrying Elizabeth of York, daughter of Edward IV of York, thereby symbolically uniting the red and white roses [@carpenter_wars_1997].

The War of the Roses had far-reaching impacts on English society and government. It weakened the power of the nobility and strengthened the power of the monarchy, setting the stage for the development of the Tudor state. It also contributed to the decline of feudalism and the rise of nationalism in England. The conflict is often remembered for the dramatic and brutal battles that were fought, as well as for its role in shaping the future of England [@chrimes_henry_1999].

## The Plantagenants

The Plantagenets were a royal dynasty that ruled England from 1154 to 1485. The dynasty was founded by Henry II, who became king of England after the death of King Stephen. The Plantagenets were descendants of the counts of Anjou, in what is now France, and they expanded their power through a combination of military conquests and political marriages.

During the Plantagenet era, England experienced significant growth and expansion. The Plantagenet kings were involved in the Crusades, the Hundred Years' War with France, and the formation of the British Empire. They also established many important institutions and laws that shaped the development of England and the wider world.

The Plantagenets were divided into two branches: the House of Lancaster and the House of York. These two houses were in conflict during the Wars of the Roses, a series of civil wars fought from 1455 to 1487. The conflict ended with the victory of the Lancastrian Henry VII, who became the first Tudor king of England and united the two houses through his marriage to Elizabeth of York.

The Plantagenets left a lasting legacy on England and the wider world. They established the legal and political systems that formed the basis of modern England, and their rule marked a turning point in English history, setting the stage for the Renaissance and the development of modern Europe.

## House of Lancaster

The House of Lancaster was a royal house of the Kingdom of England, which ruled from 1399 to 1461, and again from 1470 to 1471. It was the fourth of the five royal houses of the Plantagenet dynasty to rule England, and was founded by John of Gaunt, the third son of King Edward III.

The first Lancaster king was Henry IV, who took the throne in 1399 after overthrowing his cousin, Richard II. Henry IV's reign was marked by political turmoil, including rebellion and assassination attempts. His son, Henry V, became one of England's most successful kings, winning several major battles in the Hundred Years' War against France.

The House of Lancaster suffered a significant setback in the Wars of the Roses, a series of civil wars fought between the House of Lancaster and the House of York from 1455 to 1487. After a series of losses, the Lancaster dynasty was temporarily overthrown in 1461 by the Yorkist Edward IV. The Lancaster king, Henry VI, was restored to the throne in 1470, but was soon overthrown again in 1471 by Edward IV.

The last Lancaster king, Henry VI, was a weak ruler who suffered from mental illness. His rule was marked by political instability, and he was eventually deposed by the Yorkist Edward IV. The Lancaster dynasty was succeeded by the Tudor dynasty, which was established by Henry VII, who defeated the Yorkist Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. The Tudor dynasty united the houses of Lancaster and York through the marriage of Henry VII to Elizabeth of York, daughter of Edward IV.
